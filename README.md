# td-bisection
Graph bisection using tree decompositions.

This is a very basic implementation of the algorithm presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00694

Can be tested using the [PACE 2016](https://pacechallenge.org/2016/treewidth/) and [PACE 2017](https://pacechallenge.org/2017/treewidth/) dataset.
The file format for graphs and tree decompositions is described [here](https://pacechallenge.org/2016/treewidth/#appendix-a-graph-format).
